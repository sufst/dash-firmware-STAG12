3. Make sure EEZ studio is *closed*, then:
4. Run the generation: `cd Codegen && uv sync && uv run main.py` ([uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation))
5. Open the project inside EEZ studio, hit check then build, save the project
6. Check the project builds properly (see below)
